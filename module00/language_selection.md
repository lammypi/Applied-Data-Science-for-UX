# Language Selection

Data science can be done in a variety of languages, but the examples in this repository focus primarily on Python and R. If you're completely new to data science I recommend starting with one of these languages as they're relatively simple to learn and have many easy-to-use, well documented libraries. Also, it may turn out that if you're coming to this from a UX research background that you have experience in one or both of these languages already. In that case, this section might not be very useful for you. 


## Python vs. R   

The selection of language for your data science journey is important as it may impact your perceptions of what is and is not possible. That's not to say that you can only do certain types of work in one language versus another--there is a lot of overlap in libraries between both languages, and you can even use Python in R via reticulate (just to further drive home the point). Rather, it's easier to do some things in Python than R and vice versa.
