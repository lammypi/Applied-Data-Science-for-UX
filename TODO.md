## 📘 Core Modules (v1 content goals)
### 01 – UX Research & Survey Analysis
- [ ] 📊 MCA for analyzing categorical survey responses
- [ ] 🧠 Clustering survey respondents (e.g., KMeans, hierarchical)
- [ ] 📄 Text cleaning for open-ended responses

### 02 – Behavior & Usage Data
- [ ] 📉 PCA for simplifying feature-rich datasets (e.g., usage logs)
- [ ] 🧩 Semantic clustering of session titles or descriptions
- [ ] 📈 Time-based usage modeling (e.g., session trends)

### 03 – Experimentation & Evaluation
- [ ] 🔍 A/B test simulation (frequentist)
- [ ] 🎲 Bayesian A/B testing with priors + interpretation
- [ ] 📐 Visualizing test results for stakeholders

### 04 – Reporting & Dashboarding
- [ ] 🧰 Streamlit prototype for communicating findings
- [ ] 📊 Dashboard wireframe demo (e.g., what UX metrics to show)
- [ ] 📦 Export-ready plots with consistent UX styling

---

## 🧱 Infrastructure
- [ ] Add `helper_functions.py` with reusable plotting + data tools
- [ ] Add requirements.txt or environment.yml

---

## 📝 Nice-to-Haves for Public Release
- [ ] Add visuals to README (e.g., a workflow diagram or screenshots)
- [ ] Write a “Quick Start for UXers” guide
- [ ] Create a glossary of common data science terms in UX context
- [ ] Draft potential blog post for launch announcement
