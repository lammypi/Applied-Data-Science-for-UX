# Analyzing Open Ended Feedback

Much of traditional UX research is qualitative in nature. There are a lot of interview transcripts we have to tag and analyze, and there are sometimes a lot of text responses to survey questions that we have to relate back to data points like Likert scale ratings. This can be really, _really_ time consuming and even tie up multiple team members during the analysis phase. There are methods and tools that can make the workload a bit lighter that are built upon Natural Language Processing (NLP). This section will provide a very brief overview of NLP and the most applicable methods and tools.
