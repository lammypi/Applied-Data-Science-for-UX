If you're completely new to data science I recommend starting with one of these languages as they're relatively simple to learn and have many easy-to-use, well documented libraries. Also, it may turn out that if you're coming to this from a UX research background that you have experience in one or both of these languages already. In that case, this section might not be very useful for you."
