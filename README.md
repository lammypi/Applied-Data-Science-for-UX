# Applied Data Science for UX
A hands-on guide to applying data science techniques in UX research. This repository bridges the gap between qualitative insights and quantitative rigor with code notebooks, real-world examples, and beginner-friendly explanations.

__Why Have I Created This Repository?__

As of the time I'm creating this (April 2025), UX is undergoing a lot of shifting and uncertainty largely due to companies pushing AI regardless of whether they have a viable use case for it. In my industry, there's a greater need for UX research, and for that research to include legitimate quantitative methods. However, those methods (which seem to mainly be centered on frequentist statistics) are not going far enough. Product leaders want deeper insights into attitudes and behaviors, and how those manifest in the digital spaces companies create. UX can't provide that with parametric tests, gap analysis or the occasional semantic analysis. We need to become comfortable with the broader suite of analytics methods that can if we want to provide such insights. This repository is not me trying to democratize product analytics or diminish the skills of product analysts or product data scientists. Rather, it's my way of encouraging UX practitioners to consider acquiring additional training and moving into those roles so we can bring our perspective to the interpretation of user and product data. 

## Current Structure

### [Setting Up Your Workspace ‚ùáÔ∏è](/module00)
If you're new to using Python or R on your machine, this section can help you identify the necessary downloads to get started.

### Data Preparation üî¢
Most of the data that's useful for analytics in service of UX comes in varying degrees of messiness. That's OK, though, because you'll learn a bit about how to deal with messy data and draw out useful features for analysis.

### Do Some Basic Stats üåü
Sometimes all you need is a good ANOVA. Or Mann Whitney U test. This module is a quick review of some basic statistics.

### [Uncovering Relationships üìâ](/module03)
A large component of UX research is understanding relationships: How people relate to technology, their environments, and to each other. All of this can be captured in data, and so this module will teach correlation and regression methods to help you describe and interpret relationships captured in data.

### Classifying Your Data Points üè∑Ô∏è
If you have pre-defined groups to work with, you may find that you need to classify your data points according to those groups. This module introduces some very common classification methods.

### Detecting Groups in Your Data üë•
At some point you may face the seemingly complex task of creating groups based only on the features of the data you have. This module introduces clustering, an unsupervised learning method that relies on patterns in your data to do just that.

### Analyzing Open Ended Feedback üó®Ô∏è
Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to a variety of methods for analyzing text data--something that UX gets a lot of! The most relevant methods for NLP will be introduced in this module.

### Finding Connections üï∏Ô∏è
Finding connections within complex data might seem a bit daunting, but with Network Analytics it becomes a lot simpler. This module presents the basics of creating network graphs and metrics for analyzing them.
