# Applied-Data-Science-for-UX
A hands-on guide to applying data science techniques in UX research. This repository bridges the gap between qualitative insights and quantitative rigor with code notebooks, real-world examples, and beginner-friendly explanations.

## Current Structure

### Module 00: Setting Up Your Workspace ❇️
If you're new to using Python or R on your machine, this section can help you identify the necessary downloads to get started.

### Module 01: Data Preparation 🔢
Most of the data that's useful for analytics in service of UX comes in varying degrees of messiness. That's OK, though, because you'll learn a bit about how to deal with messy data and draw out useful features for analysis.

### Module 02: Detecting Groups in Your Data 👥
At some point you may face the seemingly complex task of creating groups based only on the features of the data you have. This module introduces clustering, an unsupervised learning method that relies on patterns in your data to do just that.

### Module 03: Analyzing Open Ended Feedback 🗨️
Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to a variety of methods for analyzing text data--something that UX gets a lot of! The most relevant methods for NLP will be introduced in this module.

### Module 04: Finding Connections 🕸️
Finding connections within complex data might seem a bit daunting, but with Network Analytics it becomes a lot simpler. This module presents the basics of creating network graphs and metrics for analyzing them.

### Module 05: Uncovering Relationships 📉
A large component of UX research is understanding relationships: How people relate to technology, their environments, and to each other. All of this can be captured in data, and so this module will teach correlation and regression methods to help you describe and interpret relationships captured in data.

### Module 06: Classifying Your Data Points 🏷️

### Appendix: Types of Analytics

### Appendix: Review of Log and Exponent Rules

### Appendix: Review of Derivatives and Differentiation Rules

### Appendix: Review of Linear Algebra
