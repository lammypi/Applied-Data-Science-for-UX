# Uncovering Relationships

The two most common ways of understanding relationships are via correlation and regression. 

If you're a UX person reading this, then you're likely very familiar with Pearson's r and Linear Regression, perhaps even with Logistic Regression. I will be covering those in their respective sections, as well as several others that wouldn't be unusual for you to encounter when seeking to apply analytics methods in service of UX.

The list of topics in each section appears below. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. What I'm presenting here are only the ones I have used. 

| [Correlations](/module03/correlations/README.md) | Regressions |

| Pearson's r | Linear regression |
| Spearmans $\rho$ | Logistic regression |
| Kendall's $\tau$ | Poisson regression |
| Point Biserial | Polynomial regression |
| Polyserial | |
| Polychoric | |
| Tetrachoric | |
